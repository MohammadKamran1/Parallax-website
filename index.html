            <h2 class="sechead">Adventure Time!</h2> <br/>
            <p class="text">An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold, sometimes risky.
                Adventures may be activities with danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing,
                scuba diving, river rafting, or other extreme sports.Adventures are often undertaken to create psychological
                arousal or in order to achieve a greater goal, such as the pursuit of knowledge that can only be obtained by such activities.
                <br/> <br/>
                Adventurous experiences create psychological arousal, which can be interpreted as negative
                or positive (e.g. flow). For some people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself.
                According to adventurer Andr√© Malraux, in his Man's Fate (1933), "If a man is not ready to risk his life, where is his dignity?".

                Similarly, Helen Keller stated that "Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.

            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Hiking, walking in nature as a recreational activity. Especially among those with sedentary occupations, hiking is a natural exercise 
                that promotes physical fitness, is economical and convenient, and requires no special equipment. Because hikers can walk as far as they want,
                there is no physical strain unless they walk among hills or mountains. Many persons walk alone, mainly on weekends or holidays, 
                but youth clubs and other groups arrange rambles, or hikes. The normal length of the walk undertaken is 7 to 12 miles (11 to 19 km) for a half day
                or 12 to 20 miles (19 to 32 km) for a full day.<br/> <br/> Those organized rambles, combining exercise with enjoyment of the countryside, are in country districts 
                surrounding large towns and follow a planned route. Most densely populated European towns have hiking trails outside them.
                For regular and intensive walkers there are available services offered by such associations as the Ramblers'
                Association in Great Britain and the Wilderness Society in the United States.

                <h2 class="desc">SWIMMING</h2> <br/>
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Swimming is an individual or team racing sport that requires the use of one's entire body to move through water. 
                The sport takes place in pools or open water (e.g., in a sea or lake). Competitive swimming is one of the most popular Olympic
                sports, with varied distance events in butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, and individual medley.
                In addition to these individual events, four swimmers can take part in either a freestyle or medley relay. 
                A medley relay consists of four swimmers who will each swim a different stroke, ordered as backstroke, breaststroke, 
                butterfly and freestyle. <br/> <br/>
                Swimming each stroke requires a set of specific techniques; in competition, there are distinct regulations concerning 
                the acceptable form for each individual stroke. There are also regulations on what types of swimsuits, caps, jewelry 
                and injury tape that are allowed at competitions.

                <h2 class="desc">Para Gliding</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched 
                glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure. The pilot sits in a harness or lies supine in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended 
                below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the 
                wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside. <br/> <br/>
                Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last 
                many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to five hours and covering some tens of kilometres are 
                more the norm. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few 
                thousand metres.
